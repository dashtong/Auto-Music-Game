##  About the Project
ユニエア is a music game with five buttons. We have to press, swipe and hold the buttons precisely in order to reach high score.  
I have built a robot with arduino and python to help us press the buttons at the accurate time and possibly achieve Full Combo (FC).

## Usage
1. Record a full gameplay with the target song and mark down the speed in setting.
2. Edit the variables' name in ```get_raw_data.py``` and run it to get a txt file that included raw data we need.
3. Upload the servo program to an arduino nano.
4. Set up camera that can clearly capture the iPad's full screen.
5. Edit the variables' name in ```camera.py``` and run it.
6. Open the calibrating photo in iPad. The screen should show a wrapped stream (a rectangular screen of iPad).
7. Start a game and Enjoy. ^_^
